    "Growth plays an important role in the development of projects and the greater ecosystem. We can detect some emerging topics by examining the growth rates of [stars](./popularity.ipynb) over the last year. The topic of green software is growing in popularity, also known as \"green computing\". Its concern is the lowering of energy consumption, carbon intensity, and environmental impact of programming languages and applications. With over 97% of the world's applications now using open source, this clearly affects energy usage and efficiency worldwide.<sup><a href=\"https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/open-source-trends-ossra-report/\">1</a></sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects like [Kepler](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler), [kube-green](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green), [Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre), [Cloud Carbon Footprint](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/), [Software Carbon Intensity Specification](https://greensoftware.foundation/projects/), and [CodeCarbon](https://codecarbon.io/) demonstrating the growth within this new topic. This trend is partially driven by new collaborative communities, such as the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation), which is supported by major software companies. The ambitious climate targets of companies like Google and Microsoft may be a contributing factor to this trend. Levels of access and participation may also play a role, as green software typically has a lower barrier to entry for general software developers than other topics.\n",

    "Another way is to look at the growth in commitment over the past year in relation to the total commits of a project. This perspective can be misleading in many ways. The number of commits created within a given time frame is highly dependent on the type of project. Websites generate many more lines of code, and therefore commits, than data analysis projects. Modular software tools that are used in dependency on other projects are much more prone to higher growth. Other dependent software tools can break when major changes are made. For this reason, high growth can also be considered a risk.  However, if you look at the fast-growing projects, you will see new upstarts in addition to the large widely known projects:\n",
