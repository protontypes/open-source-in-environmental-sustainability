# Dimensions of Sustainability

This study examines the relationship between ‘open’ approaches and environmental sustainability from the perspective of ‘open sustainability’ while touching on other areas with similar framing and scope:

**Open Sustainability** refers to the use of open technical and cultural approaches towards sustainable outcomes. The field examines how open culture and methods can contribute to environmental, social and economic sustainability. It is concerned with what and how openness as a philosophy is instrumental to sustainability through the acceleration of transparent and collaborative innovation. Within this study, this aspect will be dealt with in detail, with a particular focus on environmental sustainability in open source software.

Previous publications that address the concept of open sustainability focus primarily on open innovation within companies. The contribution of academia and open communities is not considered here, even though, especially within the open source field, these groups account for the majority of developments. <sup><a href="https://lutpub.lut.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/158649/ukko_et_al_sustainable_development_final_draft.pdf">1</a></sup> Our study shows that the application of openness is not only crucial for sustainable innovation processes in companies. It also creates transparency and trust in the quality of sustainability information. Within companies, however, this aspect is only found to a small extent.


**Green Software**, also known as Green Computing, is concerned with lowering the energy consumption, environmental impact, and carbon intensity of programming languages and applications. With over 97% of the world's applications now using open source, this clearly affects energy usage and efficiency worldwide.<sup><a href="https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/open-source-trends-ossra-report/">2</a></sup>

**Open Source Sustainability** refers to the ability of an open source project and its community to sustain themselves over a long period of time and to adapt the project to new circumstances and technologies. A strong community and governance structure is central to delivering bug fixes and new features.

 <!-- TODO consider moving to the funding chapter -->
Open source sustainability is widely known and analysed in detail within numerous books and publications.<sup><a href="https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public">3</a></sup>. A whole [ecosystem has emerged](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand#a-handy-guide-to-financial-support-for-open-source) with the objective to commercialise the support, risk analysis and funding of open source software. Within the Linux Foundation, a new community emerged to determine the health state of an open source project: Community Health Analytics Open Source Software ([CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/)). Another strong community that has formed in this space is [Sustain](https://sustainoss.org/). This work is important, as large, well-known projects typically receive more donations than small ones. However, small modular projects can be critical to the global digital infrastructure. Even though large companies use these projects, donations are small compared to the development resources that are required<sup><a href="https://staltz.com/software-below-the-poverty-line.html">4</a></sup>.
