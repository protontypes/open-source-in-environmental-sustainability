# The Role of Open Source Software

Open source software (OSS) has transformed the digital industry by accelerating the development of cloud computing, operating systems, data science and artificial intelligence. Besides core information technology infrastructure, open source software is becoming increasingly critical in environmental science, disaster impact assessment, energy efficiency, and sustainability in general. The origins of the open source software movement can be found in the development of core IT infrastructure such as operating systems, web servers and databases. Linux is by far the most widely used operating system in the field of supercomputers, embedded systems and Internet infrastructure. At the same time, the Open Science movement and “[FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)” have been instrumental in making scientific work transparent and collaborative. 

While technological breakthroughs have been widely regarded as essential to addressing climate change and environmental sustainability, OSS used in the design, operation and maintenance of human-engineered systems is rarely considered in its own right. This applies to discrete technologies, such as renewables and battery development, as well as the software that simulates and predicts complex natural systems, such as models of the atmosphere, biosphere, and the water masses of the planet.

Without understanding and simulating vital natural systems, it is impossible to understand their interrelationships, or indicate how humans can preserve this unique life-protecting world that has emerged in a completely hostile space. The mathematical models, technologies and measurement tools provide us with independent reporting on the state of the planet, and the extent of human impact. The knowledge accumulated over decades ensures that people around the world are able to understand how to preserve vital resources such as fresh water, fertile soil or clean air. 
The in-depth understanding of the Earth and its natural, economic and social systems subsequently allow us to make predictions about human actions and the associated impacts such as: 

- How does the Earth system respond to global changes caused by humans?
- What are the risks of exceeding Earth system thresholds? What are the remaining budgets? What are the targets and how do we allocate responsibility?
- What quantity of Greenhouse Gases does a product and its supply chain release into the atmosphere? 
- How can the value of material be retained and waste be reduced? 
- How is biodiversity impacted where the corresponding raw materials are produced?
- What risk does this technology pose to humans and nature in the event of a failure?

Without open data, rigorous science and open software, it is impossible to make evidence-based and verifiable assessments of the degree to which technological developments are sustainable. The manipulation and withholding of data related to the environmental impact of technologies and companies has a long history. From the[ fossil fuel industry ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil_climate_change_controversy)withholding studies about climate change; to [manipulation of data and measurements about emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_emissions_scandal) by the car industry; to a [lack of communication of important environmental safety information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident) – pollution and environmental disasters go hand in hand with opaque reporting, obfuscated data, and closed models. To avoid greenwashing and manipulation of environmental information, we need to ensure claims about the sustainability of technology, the ecological footprints of products, and the impact of human actions are based on quantifiable and verifiable evidence.
Planetary Management is an established approach to understanding how we can wisely use global resources. However, not much is known about the state of the open source and open data ecosystem that provides actionable intelligence about the state of our ecosystem. There are few efforts to date to build bridges between the various developments and to better manage collaboration and inventory. How do these open projects – which have the potential to yield actionable insights in a transparent and democratic way – evolve over the years?
