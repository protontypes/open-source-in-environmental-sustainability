Transitioning to a more sustainable future requires not only technological innovation, but also new ways of involving society in technological development. Open source culture has demonstrated the possibility of transparent and collaborative innovation, laying the groundwork for modern IT infrastructure. Open Source Software (OSS) supports traceable decision-making, builds capacity for localisation and customisation of climate technologies, and, most importantly, helps prevent greenwashing. Despite the strong transformative impact of open source culture, its potential for developing environmentally sustainable technologies is not well understood. This study provides the first analysis of the open source software ecosystem in the field of sustainability and climate technology. 

Thousands of actively developed open source projects and organisations have been collected through the [Open Sustainable Technology](https://opensustain.tech/) database and systematically analysed using qualitative and quantitative methods. The analysis covers multiple dimensions – including the technical, the social, and the organisational. It highlights key risks and challenges for users, developers, and decision makers, as well as opportunities for more systemic collaboration. Based on these unique insights, we were able to define the Open Sustainability Principles that embody open source in environmental sustainability.

This analysis indicates that open source still plays a minor role as a long-term transformation strategy in sustainability compared to other domains. Half of all identified projects are in data-rich domains such as climate science, biosphere, energy system modelling, transportation and buildings. Other topics, such as carbon offsets, battery technology, sustainable investment, emission observation and integrated assessment modelling, show few notable developments. Newly emerging topics such as green software were identified based on popularity growth while most identified projects are relatively young, with a median age of about 4 years. Moreover, programming languages Python and R dominate the ecosystem and regarding licensing, permissive licences such as MIT is preferred, followed by copyleft licence GPLv3.

Analysis of the distribution of knowledge, work, and project governance reveals that small open source communities lead most of the development, and open source projects rely heavily on a single developer responsible on average 70% of the contributions to a project. Academia and some large government agencies contribute significantly to open source while the lack of for-profit organisations and start-ups with open source business models in the space is remarkable. Finally, the majority of open source projects are based in Europe and the United States, with a small number of projects from the Global South. Despite their significant footprints, larger developments by organisations based in India and China are underrepresented or nonexistent.

This report presents the first of its kind analysis of open source technology in sustainability to provide the empirical backbone for guiding community building, policy development and future investment. Based on this analysis, we therefore propose recommendations for those interested in supporting OSS in environmental sustainability more effectively via:

- Strengthening the interconnectivity and knowledge exchange of the identified communities as well as connecting projects to local use cases. 
- Closing the knowledge gap on the environmental impact of industries and companies. Adapting and extending existing open source projects for underrepresented countries in the global south.
- Creating incubators and other support programmes for open source software in environmental sustainability as well as dedicated funds that provide core and maintenance funding.
- Developing better technical interfaces between platforms, data, models and open source tools across and within sectors to “stop reinventing the wheel”.
- Standardising environmental data and models using open source across different levels of government.Transforming financial institutions through transparent and scientific decision making for sustainable investments.

Digital and sustainable transformations must converge as a digital public good if we are to meet agreed environmental targets, and create a safe and just corridor for people and the planet. Open Sustainability Principles can help governments, research institutes, NGOs, and companies to rapidly move toward science-based decarbonisation of the economy and the conservation of natural resources and ecosystems and prevent greenwashing through transparent and traceable decision making.
