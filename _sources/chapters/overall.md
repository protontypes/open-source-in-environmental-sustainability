# Overall

Based on the insights, we propose recommendations for effectively supporting and building capacity for open source in sustainability:

- **Close the knowledge gap on the environmental impact of industries and individual companies.** This study has shown that only a few companies are willing to engage in open scientific dialogue about their environmental impact. For example, open science applied to the assessment of emissions from industrial facilities is usually conducted by external actors. Using remote sensing methods, open data on Scope 1 emissions would provide objective and invaluable verification of the source of environmental impact. One way to incentivise actors is to build openness and scientific verifiability into sustainability assessments and product disclosure statements. Projects, networks, and collaborations between independent scientists and industry that enable open science in sustainability could create a better understanding of the environmental impacts of entire industries.

- **Adapt and extend existing OSS to underrepresented countries in the Global South.** Communities in emerging economies have limited involvement in developing open knowledge, software, and data related to their natural environment. Therefore, building and empowering local communities to use open source tools for local change and technological transformation has far-reaching potential. In fast-growing nations, such as India, many developers have the potential to use OSS to understand their local environments better and thus protect essential ecosystems. Scholarships that teach young people how to use open source to understand the natural environment could greatly benefit the climate and the planet. Meanwhile, such investments are resource efficient and easily transferable worldwide. The [Learning](https://opensustain.tech/learning/) section on OpenSustain.tech can help build the foundation of the knowledge, projects and people needed. [Earthlabs](https://www.earthdatascience.org/) and [Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/) already demonstrate what such a format can look like within the field of Earth Science.

- **Establish an open Earth Intelligence Incubator**. Despite the high synergy between open source culture and sustainable environmental developments, there are few incubators or support programs specialising in environmental open source project development. While individual programs focus on non-profits and academia, there is a lack of funding, knowledge, and programs for commercial open source solutions in environmental sustainability. This trend also explains the low proportion of academic open source projects that are commercialised via open source business models. Such an incubator can fill significant gaps in the ecosystem, such as:
  - Identifying opportunities for new ventures and non-profits that creatively combine existing ecosystem components to create more public-purpose value.
  - Incentivising the development of new ventures and projects that combine existing modules and packages into effective open source products.
  - Providing project support including, marketing, design, funding packages, business model design and community management.
  - Building networks with potential users such as cities, government agencies, and nature reserves.

- **Transform financial institutions through transparent and scientific decision-making for sustainable investments.** Banks, rating agencies and investors are at the centre of our economy, allocating resources to what is deemed sustainable and viable. However, our analysis has shown that open software tools and data are the exception in this space. The lack of openness means decision-making is often opaque and vulnerable to greenwashing. The financial industry is still far from deploying sustainable investment funds which are based on open scientific methods. However, such development has the potential to create greenwashing-free investment opportunities for private and public investors. Financial products funded on open and evidence-based practices will likely gain investors' trust in creating both sustainable and favourable returns. Banks and rating agencies would thus become critical users and potential contributors to various environmentally relevant open source projects. [OS-Climate](https://os-climate.org/) already represents a significant milestone here.

[Electricity Maps](https://app.electricitymaps.com/) provides time-resolved historical data and forecasts about the amount of renewable energy in the electrical grid for countries all around the globle. In this way energy consumption can be adjusted in such a way that as few emissions as possible are produced. It provides both a solid business model and an open source community behind the project.
