# Overall

Based on the insights, we propose recommendations for those interested in supporting the OSS for sustainability more effectively:

- **Closing the knowledge gap on the environmental impact of industries and individual companies.** This study has shown that only a few companies are willing to engage in open scientific dialogue about their environmental impact. Open science, such as on emissions from industrial facilities, is usually conducted by external stakeholders. Open Scope 1 emission data would be invaluable to verify the environmental impact of companies using remote sensing methods. One way to incentivise companies is to build openness and scientific verifiability into the sustainability assessments. Projects, networks, and collaborations between independent scientists and industry that enable open science in sustainability could create a better understanding of the environmental impacts of entire industries.

- **Adaptability and extension of existing OSS for underrepresented countries in the global south.** In particular, projects in emerging economies, the global south, and Asia have limited involvement in developing open knowledge, software, and data related to their natural environment. Therefore, building and empowering local communities to use open-source tools for local change and technological transformation has far-reaching potential. Especially in fast-growing nations like India, many young people have the potential to use OSS to understand their local environments better and thus protect important ecosystems. Scholarships that teach young people how to use open source to understand the natural environment could greatly benefit the climate and the planet. At the same time, such investments are resource efficient and easily transferrable worldwide. The [Learning](https://opensustain.tech/learning/) section on OpenSustain.tech can help build the foundation of knowledge, projects and people needed. [Earthlabs](https://www.earthdatascience.org/) and [Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/) already demonstrate what such a format for the Earth Science field can look like.

- **Establish an open Earth Intelligence Incubator**. Despite the high synergy between open-source culture and sustainable environmental developments, there are no incubators or support programs specialising in environmental open-source project development. While individual programs focus on non-profits and academia, there is a lack of funding, knowledge, and programs for commercial open-source solutions in environmental sustainability. This also explains the low proportion of academic open-source projects that are commercialised via open-source business models. Such an incubator can fill significant gaps in the ecosystem, such as:
    - Identify opportunities for new ventures and non-profits that creatively combine existing ecosystem components to create more public purpose value.
    - Incentivise the development of new ventures and projects that combine modules and packages into precious open-source products.
    - Provide support, including marketing, design, funding packages, business model design and community management.
    - Networking with potential users such as cities, government agencies, and nature reserves

- **Transforming financial institutions through transparent and scientific decision-making for sustainable investments.** Banks, rating agencies and investors are at the centre of our economy and decide which inventions are sustainable and viable. However, our analysis has shown that open software tools and data are the exception in this space. This makes decision-making opaque and vulnerable to greenwashing. The financial industry is still far away from sustainable investment funds designed based on open scientific methods. However, such development has the potential to create greenwashing-free investment opportunities for private and public investors. Financial products that use open and evidence-based practices for their decisions can significantly contribute to securing investors' trust. Banks and rating agencies would thus become critical users and potential contributors to various environmentally relevant open-source projects. [OS-Climate](https://os-climate.org/) already represents a significant milestone here.
