# Funding

<!-- - **Applying the "Open Source First" criterion when providing funding for sustainable technologies.** Our study has shown that open source can have a significant impact on sustainable choices and technology diffusion. However, when it comes to financing sustainable technology projects, open source is often not a decisive investment criterion. A fundamental rethink needs to take place here. Openness must be recognised as a key indicator for sustainable development. In particular, the investment of public funds can help to reverse the trend and ensure that such investments also benefit the general public in the long term. Public research and development projects must be made easier to develop and promote open source projects with their own financial resources. This can contribute significantly to ensuring that public funds do not end up as the proprietary intellectual property of universities or companies, but that free circulation of these sustainable developments is possible. Only through open licensing can it be ensured that sustainable developments are actually applied worldwide. -->

- **Deploy dedicated funds for core development and maintenance.** Stable and secure funding for core product development is foundational for maintaining ongoing, high-quality project support. Maintenance funding for OSS for sustainability should be given extra attention. This may include allocating funds to:

  - Develop documentation, code libraries, training, or other resources that make it easier for more people to manage and develop and extend existing technology
  - Develop robust solutions to recurrent short-term problems such as solving legacy problems
  - Complete migration from legacy code
  - Improve the design and user experience of technology
  - Establish or adopt technical standards

  The insights, methods and tools developed within the framework of this study can contribute significantly to making such investments transparent and targeted.

- **Embed open source principles within philanthropic and impact investment**. Organisations across sectors are increasingly recognising their own reliance on open source, with over 97% of modern digital infrastructure leveraging open source code.<sup><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3891628">1</a></sup> There is also a realisation of the material benefits organisation and societies reap from adopting and engaging in open source â€“ both directly, as well the co-benefits of collaborative innovation. From the [largest health management information system](https://github.com/dhis2) in the world to [pandemic tractability](https://github.com/zerobase-io/smart-tracing) and [climate change adaptation](https://github.com/spaceml-org/ml4floods) tools, the scale and impact of open source is vast. However, direct contributions to this growing shared resource is rarely considered as a desired outcome within philanthropic and social impact circles. Our findings reveal that a bottom-up convergence of digital and sustainability transformations are crucial to bridging the digital divide and achieving an inclusive, regenerative and circular economy. We encourage philanthropists and impact investors to recognise the transformative properties of open source and its cascading effects, particularly within environmental sustainability, and embody these principles within their funding criteria. Examples of funders embracing this collaborative orientation, seeking to maximise the impact of their resources, include [Climate Subak](https://subak.org/), the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/), and the community-driven platform [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/).

- **Make open source a priority for government investment.** Governments at all levels can play a central role in building capacity for OSS in sustainability and beyond by making open source a priority when developing internal systems, within the procurement process, and when funding research and development where software and hardware are outputs. There are many direct and indirect benefits of taking this approach, which are highlighted throughout this report. Importantly, building interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary capacity around open source information and technology has cascading effects across business, academia, industry and the community; stimulating endogenous growth,<sup><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and">1</a>,<a href="https://ictlogy.net/bibliography/reports/projects.php?idp=895&lang=en">2</a></sup> labour productivity,<sup><a href="https://github.blog/2022-01-20-open-source-creates-value-but-how-do-you-measure-it/#footnote1">1</a></sup> and the formation of start-ups.<sup><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/20-139_bd835fdf-a293-4912-aa21-769e77f2754a.pdf">3</a></sup> Increased economic complexity and resource efficiency gains are also evident.<sup><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and">1</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921344922003664">2</a></sup> According to research from the European Commission, an increase in contributions to open source software (OSS) of 10% per year results in a GDP increase of 0.4% to 0.6%, as well as the creation of more than 600 new technology start-ups in the EU.<sup><a href="https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/informatics/open-source-software-strategy_en">3</a></sup> OSS presents clear environmental, economic, and social advantages, and should therefore be seen as a key component of effective digital innovation or sustainability strategies. With many governments acknowledging the Sustainable Development Goals within their internal policy, we encourage policy and decision makers to assess their contribution towards these Global goals within the context of open source and public-purpose value, particularly with respect to environmental sustainability. New alliances, such as [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard), play an important role in generating a shared understanding of the benefits of supporting and fostering open source, together with governments at scale.
