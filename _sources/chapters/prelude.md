# Prelude
## Gathering

In 2019, Eirini Malliaraki curated a collection of open data in the field of environmental information. [Data for Environmental Intelligence](https://github.com/rockita/Environmental_Intelligence) gives an overview of open and freely available resources on the state of our natural environment. It was created with the aim of helping developers, journalists, scientists – ultimately, anyone with access to an internet connection – to find information on how our planet's natural systems are changing.

In the same year, Tobias Augspurger curated a list of open source robotic tools for professional robotic development with the Robotic Operation System (ROS). Based on his experience leading the development of a [complete robotic software stack at DHL](https://rosindustrial.org/news/2020/5/11/guest-article-on-the-story-of-the-autonomous-logistics), primarily based on open source tools, he became convinced that *Open Source will play an increasingly important role in the co-evolution of technology and society*.

Together with the online community *protontypes*, they launched the [Open Sustainable Technology](https://opensustain.tech/) project to map all open source software repositories in the field of environmental sustainability. Their goal was to capture a complete picture of this emerging open source ecosystem. It quickly became clear that a wealth of information could be derived from this database that warranted further investigation.

In September 2021, Eirini and Tobias joined forces towards a common goal: to explore and understand the intersection of open source, environmental sustainability, and technology, and to share their findings and insights with the public. Further collaborations were agreed upon to build a global picture of the open source ecosystem. In 2022, Josh Hopkins joined to investigate the open source projects in the context of digital public goods for communities and decision-makers, led by sustainability intelligence non-profit organisation, Open Corridor.

## The Role of Open Source Software

Open source software (OSS) has transformed industries by accelerating the development of cloud computing, operating systems, application development, data science and artificial intelligence. Open source approaches allowed for the rapid development of many of the advanced systems which our economies and societies rely upon. Linux is by far the most widely used operating system in supercomputers, embedded systems and internet infrastructure. While there is no central authority by design, the Open Source movement is guided by common principles, such as the [Fundamental Principles](https://opensource.org/osd), defined by the Open Source Initiative. At the same time, the Open Science movement and [FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) have been instrumental in making scientific work transparent and collaborative. 

Besides core information technology infrastructure, open source software is becoming increasingly critical in environmental science<sup><a href="https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/86473/1/OpenResearchCaseStudy-2019-Blower.pdf">1</a></sup>, disaster impact assessment<sup><a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1094&context=foss4g">2</a></sup>, energy efficiency<sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3337773">3</a></sup>, and sustainability<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-13-7099-1">4</a></sup> in general. While technological advances are critical to addressing climate change and environmental sustainability, OSS used in the design, operation, and maintenance of human-engineered systems is rarely considered in its own right. This applies to renewables, batteries, and software that simulates and predicts complex natural systems like the atmosphere, biosphere, and water bodies.

```

Without understanding and simulating vital natural systems, it is impossible to understand their interrelationships, or indicate how humans can preserve this unique life-protecting world that has emerged in a completely hostile space. Mathematical models, technologies and measurement tools provide us with independent reporting on the state of the planet, and the extent of human impacts. Knowledge accumulated over decades ensures that people around the world are able to understand how to preserve vital resources such as fresh water, fertile soil or clean air. The in-depth understanding of the Earth and its natural, economic and social systems subsequently allow us to make predictions about human actions and associated impacts such as: 

- How does the Earth system respond to global anthropogenic changes?
- What are the risks of exceeding Earth system thresholds? What are the remaining budgets? What are the targets and how do we allocate responsibility?
- What quantity of Greenhouse Gases does a product and its supply chain release into the atmosphere? 
- How can the value of materials be retained and waste be reduced? 
- How is biodiversity impacted where the corresponding raw materials are produced?
- What risk does a particular technology pose to humans and nature in the event of a failure?

Without open data, rigorous science and open software, it is impossible to make evidence-based and verifiable assessments about the feasibility of various technological developments. The manipulation and withholding of data related to the environmental impact of technologies and companies has a long history. From the[ fossil fuel industry ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil_climate_change_controversy) withholding studies about climate change; to [manipulation of data and measurements about emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_emissions_scandal) by the automotive industry; to a [lack of communication of important environmental safety information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident) – pollution and environmental disasters go hand in hand with opaque reporting, obfuscated data, and closed-sourced models. To avoid greenwashing and manipulation of environmental information, we need to ensure claims about the sustainability of technology, the ecological footprints of products, and the impact of human actions are based on quantifiable and verifiable evidence.

## A Brief History of Open Source Culture in Sustainability

Open environmental data has a very long but not well known history. Without the exchange of measurement data between meteorologists, weather forecasting would have been impossible to collaborate in the early days of this scientific field. The origin of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stretches back almost 150 years, and international data sharing has been central to its activities from the very beginning. 

With the advent of the space age, the small number of weather satellites forced nations around the world to share data between different observatories in order to understand the state of the atmosphere and other Earth systems as a whole. The weather forecasts that became possible as a result of this innovation added significant value to all sectors of society. This open planetary-scale computation project increased our awareness of anthropogenic climate change and our ability to act in this environment.

Despite increasingly strong commercial interests in civil satellite data, a strong culture of open data and open science has been established to date. 41% of the unclassified Earth observation satellite programs of the 10 largest nations today provide open data<sup><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262037181/open-space/">5</a></sup>. Open access to this data has led to a rapid increase in the number of downloads shown in {numref}`open-satellite` using the example of the Landsat Archive. The creation of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), launched at the Second World Climate Conference, also committed parties to support international and intergovernmental sharing of data and analysis<sup><a href="https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/conveng.pdf">6</a></sup>. The urgent need for a transition to a more sustainable society, and clear signs of anthropogenic climate change, have created multiple new movements and organisations with similar open ethoses and mandates in other domains alongside Earth observation: 

- In the energy sector the [OpenMod Initiative](https://openmod-initiative.org/) formed in 2014 with the goal of opening up energy models, so the sector as a whole can improve the quality, transparency, and credibility of its products and create better research and policy. 
- In 2017 academic Stefan Pfenninger [wrote an article published in in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/542393a.pdf) urging scientists to “Free The Models” for the energy sector – a call to action supported by influential scientists like Auke Hoekstra and politicians like Michael Liebreich. This led to the sector pushing toward open data and open source code – a move that will be critical for a fossil fuel-free economy transition.
- In 2018, Shuli Goodman founded the [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/), an open source organisation within the Linux Foundation that enables companies worldwide to develop energy systems related OSS tools collaboratively. 
- [ClimateChange.ai](https://www.climatechange.ai/) convenes an open community and provides multiple educational resources around tackling climate change through artificial intelligence – another technological revolution that has been catalysed by open source culture. 
- The [Open Climate Community Calls](https://www.appropedia.org/Open_Climate) created worldwide connections between multiple individuals from different domains – to understand the [relationship](https://branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-2/open-climate-now/) between openness and climate change.
-  [OS-Climate](https://os-climate.org/) created another large-scale Linux Foundation collaboration between major companies to increase transparency and traceability in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings and support sustainable investment with an open source toolchain.
-  [The Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) is an initiative endorsed by the UN Secretary-General that facilitates the discovery and deployment of digital public goods. Similarly to the [Open Sustainable Technology](https://opensustain.tech/) project, it provides an index of value open source projects but to sustainability in general, accompanied by a [billion dollar investment](https://youtu.be/NlzKChvgk9Y) commitment.

## Defining ‘Open Sustainability’

This study examines the relationship between ‘open’ approaches and environmental sustainability from the perspective of ‘open sustainability’, but touches on others with similar framing and scope:

**Open Sustainability** refers to the use of open source technical approaches for the benefit of the environment. The field examines how open source culture and methods can contribute to economic, ecological, and social sustainability. It describes more what open source can do for the environment and less what the environment can do for open source. *Within this study, this aspect will be dealt with in more detail, especially with a focus on environmental sustainability*. 

**Green Software**, also known as Green Computing, is concerned with lowering the energy consumption, environmental impact, and carbon intensity of programming languages and applications. With over 97% of the world's applications now using open source, this clearly affects energy usage and efficiency worldwide.<sup><a href="https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/open-source-trends-ossra-report/">6</a></sup>

**Open Source Sustainability** refers to the ability of an open source project and its community to sustain themselves over a long period of time and to adapt the project to new circumstances and technologies. A strong community and governance structure is central to delivering bug fixes and new features. This is widely known and analysed in detail within books and publications.<sup><a href="https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public">7</a></sup> 

Large, well-known projects receive more donations than small ones. However, small modular projects can also be very critical to the global digital infrastructure. Even though large companies use these projects, donations are small compared to the development resources that are required<sup><a href="https://staltz.com/software-below-the-poverty-line.html">8</a></sup>. A whole [ecosystem emerged](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand#a-handy-guide-to-financial-support-for-open-source) from this problem – with the objective of trying to commercialise the support, risk analysis and funding of open source software. Within the Linux Foundation, a new community emerged to determine the health state of an open source project: Community Health Analytics Open Source Software ([CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/)). Another strong community that has formed in this space is [Sustain](https://sustainoss.org/).
