# Prelude
## Gathering

In 2019, Eirini Malliaraki curated a collection of open data in the field of environmental information. [Data for Environmental Intelligence](https://github.com/rockita/Environmental_Intelligence) gives an overview of open and freely available resources on the state of our natural environment. It was created with the aim of helping developers, journalists, scientists – ultimately, anyone with access to an internet connection – to find information on how our planet's natural systems are changing. 

In the same year, Tobias Augspurger curated a list of open source robotic tools for professional robotic development with the Robotic Operation System (ROS). Based on his experience leading the development of a [complete robotic software stack at DHL](https://rosindustrial.org/news/2020/5/11/guest-article-on-the-story-of-the-autonomous-logistics), primarily based on open source tools, he became convinced that *Open Source will have a significant impact on how technology and the relationship to societies will evolve in the future*. 

Together with the online community *protontypes* they created the [Open Sustainable Technology](https://opensustain.tech/) project to map all open source software repositories in the field of environmental sustainability. Their goal was to capture a complete picture of this emerging open source ecosystem. It soon became clear that a wealth of information could be derived from this database, and warranted further study.

In September 2021 Eirini and Tobias combined their efforts towards a common goal: to study and understand the intersection of open source, environmental sustainability, and technology and to share their findings and insights with the public. Further collaborations have been established to capture a global picture of this open source ecosystem. In 2022, Josh Hopkins joined to investigate which open source projects can be integrated into digital public goods for communities and decision-makers, led by sustainability intelligence non-profit, Open Corridor. Shortly after, Kasia Kulma joined. Kasia uses the online open source repository [Climate Change Data](https://github.com/KKulma/climate-change-data) to collect open data sources and power APIs for a wide range of stakeholders.

## The Role of Open Source Software

Open source software (OSS) has transformed industry by accelerating the development of cloud computing, operating systems, data science and artificial intelligence. Besides core information technology infrastructure, open source software is becoming increasingly critical in environmental science<sup><a href="https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/86473/1/OpenResearchCaseStudy-2019-Blower.pdf">1</a></sup>, disaster impact assessment<sup><a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1094&context=foss4g">2</a></sup>, energy efficiency<sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3337773">3</a></sup>, and sustainability<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-13-7099-1">4</a></sup> in general. The origins of the open source software movement can be found in the development of core IT infrastructure such as operating systems, web servers and databases. Linux is by far the most widely used operating system in supercomputers, embedded systems and Internet infrastructure. At the same time, the Open Science movement and “[FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)” has been instrumental in making scientific work transparent and collaborative. 

While technological breakthroughs have been widely regarded as essential to addressing climate change and environmental sustainability, OSS used in the design, operation and maintenance of human-engineered systems is rarely considered in its own right. This applies to technologies such as renewables and battery development as well as the software that simulates and predicts complex natural systems, such as models of the atmosphere, biosphere, and water bodies.

Without understanding and simulating vital natural systems, it is impossible to understand their interrelationships, or indicate how humans can preserve this unique life-protecting world that has emerged in a completely hostile space. Mathematical models, technologies and measurement tools provide us with independent reporting on the state of the planet, and the extent of human impacts; while knowledge accumulated over decades ensures that people around the world are able to understand how to preserve vital resources such as fresh water, fertile soil or clean air. The in-depth understanding of the Earth and its natural, economic and social systems subsequently allow us to make predictions about human actions and associated impacts such as: 

- How does the Earth system respond to global anthropogenic changes?
- What are the risks of exceeding Earth system thresholds? What are the remaining budgets? What are the targets and how do we allocate responsibility?
- What quantity of Greenhouse Gases does a product and its supply chain release into the atmosphere? 
- How can the value of materials be retained and waste be reduced? 
- How is biodiversity impacted where the corresponding raw materials are produced?
- What risk does a particular technology pose to humans and nature in the event of a failure?

Without open data, rigorous science and open software, it is impossible to make evidence-based and verifiable assessments of the degree to which technological developments are sustainable. The manipulation and withholding of data related to the environmental impact of technologies and companies has a long history. From the[ fossil fuel industry ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil_climate_change_controversy) withholding studies about climate change; to [manipulation of data and measurements about emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_emissions_scandal) by the autonomotive industry; to a [lack of communication of important environmental safety information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident) – pollution and environmental disasters go hand in hand with opaque reporting, obfuscated data, and closed-sourced models. To avoid greenwashing and manipulation of environmental information, we need to ensure claims about the sustainability of technology, the ecological footprints of products, and the impact of human actions are based on quantifiable and verifiable evidence.

To add to this, planetary management is an established approach to understanding how we can wisely use global resources. However, not much is known about the state of the open source and open data ecosystem that provides actionable intelligence about the state of our ecosystems. There are few efforts to date to build bridges between the various developments and to better manage collaboration and inventory. 

## A brief History of Open Source Culture in Sustainability

Open environmental data has a very long but not well known history. Without the exchange of measurement data between meteorologists, weather forecasting would have been impossible to collaborate in the early days of this scientific field. The origin of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stretches back almost 150 years, and international data sharing has been central to its activities from the very beginning. 

With the beginning of the space age, the small number of weather satellites forced nations around the world to share data between different observatories to understand the state of the atmosphere and other Earth systems as a whole. The weather forecasts that became possible in this way generated significant value for all sectors of society. This open planetary-scale computation endeavour gave us increased awareness of anthropogenic climate change and increased ability to act in this environment.

Despite increasingly strong commercial interests in civil satellite data, a strong culture of open data and open science has been established to date. 41% of the unclassified Earth Observation Satellite programs of the 10 largest nations today provide open data<sup><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262037181/open-space/">5</a></sup>. The creation of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), launched at the Second World Climate Conference, also committed parties to support international and intergovernmental sharing of data and analysis<sup><a href="https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/conveng.pdf">6</a></sup>. The urgent need for a transition to a more sustainable society, and clear signs of anthropogenic climate change, have created multiple new movements and organisations with similar open ethoses and mandates in other domains alongside Earth observation: 

- In the energy sector the [OpenMod Initiative](https://openmod-initiative.org/) formed in 2014 with the goal of opening up energy models, so the sector as a whole can improve the quality, transparency, and credibility of its products and create better research and policy. 
- In 2017 academic Stefan Pfenninger [wrote an article published in in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/542393a.pdf) urging scientists to “Free The Models” for the energy sector – a call to action supported by influential scientists like Auke Hoekstra and politicians like Michael Liebreich. This led to the sector pushing toward open data and open source code – a move that will be critical for a fossil fuel-free economy transition.
- In 2018, Shuli Goodman founded the [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/), an open source organisation within the Linux Foundation aimed at the power systems sector. It enables companies worldwide to develop energy-related open software tools collaboratively. 
- [ClimateChange.ai](https://www.climatechange.ai/) convenes an open community with multiple educational resources around tackling climate change through the power of artificial intelligence – another technological revolution that has been catalysed by open source culture. 
- The [Open Climate Community Calls](https://www.appropedia.org/Open_Climate) created worldwide connections between multiple individuals from different domains – to understand the [relation](https://branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-2/open-climate-now/)ship between openness and climate change.
-  [OS-Climate](https://os-climate.org/) created another large-scale collaboration between major companies under the Linux Foundation to bring more transparency and traceability into Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings – and support sustainable investment with the help of an open source toolchain.
-  [The Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) is an initiative endorsed by the UN Secretary-General that facilitates the discovery and deployment of digital public goods. Similarly to the [Open Sustainable Technology](https://opensustain.tech/) project, it provides an index of value open source projects but to sustainability in general, accompanied by a [billion dollar investment](https://youtu.be/NlzKChvgk9Y) commitment.
