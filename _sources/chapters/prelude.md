# Prelude
## Gathering

In 2019, Eirini Malliaraki curated a collection of open data in the field of environmental information. [Data for Environmental Intelligence](https://github.com/rockita/Environmental_Intelligence) gives an overview of open and freely available resources on the state of our natural environment. It was created with the aim of helping developers, journalists, scientists – ultimately, anyone with access to an internet connection – to find information on how our planet’s natural systems are changing.

In the same year, Tobias Augspurger curated a list of open source robotic tools for professional robotic development with the Robotic Operation System (ROS). Based on his experience leading the development of a [complete robotic software stack at DHL](https://rosindustrial.org/news/2020/5/11/guest-article-on-the-story-of-the-autonomous-logistics), primarily based on open source tools, he became convinced that *open source will play an increasingly important role in the co-evolution of technology and society*.

Together with the online community *[protontypes](https://protontypes.eu/)*, they launched the [Open Sustainable Technology](https://opensustain.tech/) project to map all open source software repositories in the field of environmental sustainability. Their goal was to capture a complete picture of this emerging open source ecosystem. It quickly became clear that a wealth of information could be derived from this database that warranted further investigation.

In September 2021, Eirini and Tobias joined forces towards a common goal: to explore and understand the intersection of open source, environmental sustainability, and technology, and to share their findings and insights with the public. Further collaborations were agreed upon to build a global picture of the open source ecosystem. In 2022, Josh Hopkins joined to investigate open source projects in the context of digital public goods for communities and decision-makers, led by sustainability intelligence non-profit organisation [Open Corridor](https://www.opencorridor.org).

## The Role of Open Source Software

Open source relies on the openness of source code, the ability to modify it, and the freedom to distribute it. Open source software (OSS) is developed through the collaborative efforts of distributed communities, who work together to improve software solutions and share their modifications with others, resulting in an efficient allocation of resources and more robust and reliable products. It is foundational in establishing a digital commons, supporting open innovation communities, managing software development lifecycles, and informing social practices for managing shared resources.

While there is no central authority by design, the open source movement is guided by common principles, such as the [Fundamental Principles](https://opensource.org/osd), defined by the Open Source Initiative. At the same time, the Open Science movement and [FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) have been instrumental in making scientific work transparent and collaborative.

Open source software has transformed industries, allowing for the rapid development of many of the advanced systems which our economies and societies rely upon. Today open source is dominant in 90% of cloud computing,<sup><a href="https://www.rackspace.com/en-gb/blog/realising-the-value-of-cloud-computing-with-linux">1</a></sup> 82% of smartphones,<sup><a href="https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share">2</a></sup> 97% of application development,<sup><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3891628">3</a>,<a href="https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/open-source-trends-ossra-report">4</a></sup> and most artificial intelligence and data science.<sup><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-source-ai">5</a></sup> Linux is by far the most widely used operating system in embedded systems, internet infrastructure, and supercomputers, with all of the top 500 most powerful supercomputers in the world running a Linux distribution.<sup><a href="https://www.top500.org">6</a></sup> Not surprisingly, 90% of the Fortune Global 500 leverage OSS.<sup><a href="https://fortune.com/2013/05/06/how-linux-conquered-the-fortune-500">7</a></sup>. This trend is also evident in venture capital investments in commercial open source software with a total investment of \$24B between 2020 and 2022.<sup><a href="https://www.coss.community/cossc/global-vc-funding-into-coss-24b-raised-from-jan-2020-to-august-2022-3pc6">8</a></sup> Several larger companies with annual revenues of more than \$100M are on the rise.<sup><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17nKMpi_Dh5slCqzLSFBoWMxNvWiwt2R-t4e_l7LPLhU/edit#gid=0">9</a></sup> The total market for open source services is expected to reach \$66.84B by 2026.<sup><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201113005374/en/66.84-Billion-Open-Source-Services-Market-by-Industry-Service-Type-and-Geography---Global-Forecast-to-2026---ResearchAndMarkets.com

Without the high modularity made possible by open source, software development as we know it today would not exist. Package managers and indices such as PyPA and pip for Python enabled the simple and secure distribution of software components. This process of knowledge generation, adaptation and transformation has been known in mathematics and the natural sciences for centuries. Now it finds its application in open source software development. This approach is often described with the metaphor of "[standing on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)", which is explained in more detail in the chapter {ref}`open-sustainability-principles`. Modern software development is based on the developments of thousands of small projects that have been released as open source over the last decades. {numref}`dependency` illustrates the connection of a typical open source project with several other releases within the ecosystem.


Besides core information technology infrastructure, open source software is becoming increasingly critical in environmental science,<sup><a href="https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/86473/1/OpenResearchCaseStudy-2019-Blower.pdf">11</a></sup> disaster impact assessment,<sup><a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1094&context=foss4g">12</a></sup> energy efficiency,<sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3337773">13</a></sup> and sustainability<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-13-7099-1">14</a></sup> in general. While technological advances are critical to addressing climate change and environmental sustainability, OSS used in the design, operation, and maintenance of human-engineered systems is rarely considered in its own right. This applies to technologies such as energy production and storage, as well as software that simulates and predicts complex natural systems including the atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere.

Without observing and simulating vital natural systems, it is impossible to understand their interrelationships, or indicate how humans can preserve this unique, life-protecting world that has emerged in a completely hostile space. Mathematical models, technologies and measurement tools can provide us with independent reporting on the state of the planet, and the extent of human impacts. The knowledge accumulated over decades ensures that people around the world can understand how to preserve vital resources such as fresh water, fertile soil, clean air, and a stable climate. The in-depth understanding of the Earth and its natural, economic and social systems subsequently allows us to ask critical questions and make accurate predictions about human actions and associated impacts such as:

- How does the Earth system respond to global anthropogenic changes?
- What are the risks of exceeding Earth system thresholds? What are the remaining operating budgets? How do we set targets and allocate responsibility?
- What quantity of greenhouse gases does a product and its supply chain release into the atmosphere?
- How can the value of materials be retained and waste be reduced?
- How does the demand for natural resources impact ecosystems, and how can biodiversity be conserved?
- What are the most effective methods for capturing, storing, and distributing energy?
- What risk does a particular technology pose to humans and the environment in the event of a failure?

Without open data, rigorous science and open software, it is impossible to make evidence-based and verifiable assessments about the feasibility of technologies and their potential impact. The manipulation and withholding of information related to the environmental impact of technologies and companies has a long history. From the [fossil fuel industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil_climate_change_controversy) withholding studies about climate change; to [manipulation of data and measurements about emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_emissions_scandal) by the automotive industry; to a [lack of communication of important environmental safety information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident) – pollution and environmental disasters go hand in hand with opaque reporting, obfuscated data, and closed-sourced models. To avoid greenwashing and manipulation of environmental information, we need to ensure that claims about the sustainability of technology, the environmental footprints of products, and the impact of human actions are based on quantifiable and verifiable evidence.

## A Brief History of Open Source Culture in Sustainability

Open environmental data has a very long but not well-known history. Without the exchange of measurement data between meteorologists, it would have been impossible to achieve accurate weather forecasting in the early days of this scientific field. The origin of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stretches back almost 150 years, and international collaboration and data sharing have been central to its activities from the very beginning.

With the advent of the space age, the small number of weather satellites forced nations around the world to share data between different observatories in order to understand the state of the atmosphere and other Earth systems as a whole. The weather forecasts that became possible as a result of this innovation added significant value to all sectors of society. This open, planetary-scale computation project increased our awareness of anthropogenic climate change and our ability to act in this environment.

Despite increasingly strong commercial interests in civil satellite data, a strong culture of open data and open science has been established to date. 41% of the unclassified Earth observation satellite programs of the 10 largest nations today provide open data.<sup><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262037181/open-space/">15</a></sup> Open access to this data has led to a rapid increase in the number of downloads shown in {numref}`open-satellite` using the example of the Landsat Archive. The creation of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), launched at the Second World Climate Conference, also committed parties to support international and intergovernmental sharing of data and analysis.<sup><a href="https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/conveng.pdf">16</a></sup> The urgent need for a transition to a more sustainable society, and clear signs of anthropogenic climate change, have created multiple new movements and organisations – all with similar open ethos and mandates across domains:

- In the energy sector, the [OpenMod Initiative](https://openmod-initiative.org/) formed in 2014 with the goal of opening up energy models, so the sector as a whole can improve the quality, transparency, and credibility of its products and create better research and policy.
- In 2017, academic Stefan Pfenninger [wrote an article published in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/542393a.pdf) urging scientists to “Free The Models” for the energy sector – a call to action supported by influential scientists like Auke Hoekstra and politicians like Michael Liebreich. This led to the sector pushing toward open data and open source code – a move that will be critical for the transition to a  fossil fuel-free economy.
- In 2018, Shuli Goodman founded the [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/), an open source organisation within the Linux Foundation that enables companies worldwide to develop energy systems related OSS tools collaboratively. 
- [ClimateChange.ai](https://www.climatechange.ai/) convenes an open community and provides multiple educational resources around tackling climate change through artificial intelligence – another technological revolution that has been catalysed by open source culture.
- The [Open Climate Community Calls](https://www.appropedia.org/Open_Climate) created worldwide connections between multiple individuals from different domains – to understand the [relationship](https://branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-2/open-climate-now/) between openness and climate change.
- [OS-Climate](https://os-climate.org/) created another large-scale Linux Foundation collaboration between major companies to increase transparency and traceability in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings and support sustainable investment through an open source toolchain.
- [The Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) is an initiative endorsed by the UN Secretary-General that facilitates the discovery and deployment of digital public goods. Similarly to the [Open Sustainable Technology](https://opensustain.tech/) project, it provides an index of valuable open source projects related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, accompanied by a [billion-dollar investment](https://youtu.be/NlzKChvgk9Y) commitment.
- The [Coalition for Digital Environment Sustainability (CODES)](https://www.sparkblue.org/CODES), is an international multi-stakeholder alliance bringing together the scientific community, governmental institutions, NGOs, tech companies, and civil society to champion digital sustainability.
