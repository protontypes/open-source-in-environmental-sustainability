# Funding

- **Development of dedicated funds that provide core and maintenance funding**: Stable and secure funding for core product development is foundational for maintaining quality and ongoing project support. Maintenance funding for OSS for sustainability should be given extra attention. This may include creating funds to: 

  - Develop documentation, code libraries, training, or other resources that make it easier for more people to manage and build on existing technologies. 
  - Develop robust solutions to recurrent short-term problems such as solving legacy problems. 
  - Complete migration from legacy code. 
  - Improve the design and user experience of technology; and 
  - Establish or adopt technical standards. 

**The insights, methods and tools developed in this study can contribute to making such investments transparent and more targeted.**
