    "**The popularity of the topic can be determined by summing the number of stars given to all projects.** There are a total of 118,184 Stars across all of the identified projects; but a search on GitHub reveals that there are 27 projects that have more stars than the entire software in environmental sustainability combined! With a median of 41 stars, the field of sustainable technology can be considered rather unpopular on GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of stars of a repository is one straightforward indicator of its popularity. Growth in energy, transportation, Earth observation, and meteorology are just a few examples of areas where software innovations are important, explaining why OSS is so widely used. **With only 3 projects that have more than 1000 stars, it becomes again apparent how little popularity the topic area of Environmental Sustainability has within Open Source.** "
