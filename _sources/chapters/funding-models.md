# Funding Models

There is a broad range of funding models behind the actors in this sector. Academic and research funding, private sector investment, and government grants all benefited these OSS projects. Because the structure and ecosystem behind each project differ, each project has different funding models.

**Only 3.8% of the projects studied officially offer GitHub users the option to donate.** This is particularly difficult to explain due to the high proportion of purely community-based projects. One reason could be the low usage and popularity in general, which leads to developers not even expecting to receive donations.

**Public sector funding from research councils, the European Union, academic labs and national labs play a transformative role in sustaining OSS projects in sustainability.** Universities are not only knowledge providers but can also bring stability, independence and access to developer resources via their [Research Software Engineering](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Software_Engineering) teams.

**However, there are very few dedicated funds for OSS development and maintenance in sustainability.** Large academic projects prioritise academic research and dedicate tiny amounts of funding to open source software development. Where there are funds, such as UKRI's Infrastructure Fund in the UK, or Horizon Europe, they primarily aim to support new feature development (and frequently not at the scale that supports significant strategic software developments). There is no dedicated fund or consideration around maintenance; Developers and Research software engineers, in academic labs, are trying to squeeze in person months in multiple concurrent projects and make that open infrastructure reusable across many projects. Since features are used across many projects, assigning maintenance or user support costs to any particular development is complex.

This challenge is also reflected in OSS projects developed by non-profits and think tanks, whereby funding for a new project is relatively easy to obtain, while virtually impossible to raise funding for maintaining the software and data infrastructure. Very few funders focus on the use and maintenance phase of the project development lifecycle. One of the few exceptions here is the [Shuttleworth Foundation](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/).

**Projects with larger user bases (e.g.** [**openFAST**](https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast)**) have a mix of investments, grants and a small income from industry.** However, these projects are more likely to get stuck in technical debt, making maintenance and future development even more expensive. These more mature projects require greater funding from industry and governments. However, in many cases, if a lab-led project would like to take donations or seek alternate grant funding, an alternative business structure and legal entity would be required. This is currently not feasible in government-funded labs, research councils, and academic labs.

**Collaboration between industry and academia brings new challenges and opportunities.** The commercial application of open source code developed within academia requires intensive and long-term financial support, most of which cannot be provided from within academia. Companies and start-ups that make use of these academic projects can fill a crucial gap here. The developers we spoke to were familiar with hybrid business models such as [Open Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model), where the core of the code base is open source. At the same time, the project maintainers want to support open source without commercialisation being at the expense of the community. Maintainers are aware that their users and contributors may be upset if they feel that open source work is being used by companies for profit. Choosing the right open source business model, developer involvement and organisational form is crucial to ensure successful commercial application and community development.

**Industry-consulting models have mixed success so far.** In some circumstances (like green IT/data centre operations), open-sourcing the code is a hard requirement from a developer's perspective. In this case, the response from industrial partners has been positive. In other instances, companies wanted to keep the project used to model their systems (e.g., batteries) closed source for several years, as they were worried that their competitors would use them for free. However, it be may counterproductive to maintain closed sourced culture while attempting to rapidly scale sustainable outcomes.

**Finally, it is critical to demonstrate and quantify the impact of OSS sustainability projects in the industry.** Government departments fund academic labs that in turn collaborate with industry partners to develop new functionality. In addition, research funders and government agencies, such as the US Department of Energy, are interested in encouraging innovation in specific strategic sectors, such as renewable energy. When academic projects can demonstrate to public funders the value of open source work outside academia and demonstate the co-benefits and return on investment, it becomes easier for these projects to raise funding.
