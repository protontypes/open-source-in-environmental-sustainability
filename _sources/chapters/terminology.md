# Terminology

When it comes to the terms sustainability and open source, different perspectives may be meant depending on the context. This study examines the relationship between ‘open’ approaches and environmental sustainability from the perspective of ‘open sustainability’. This must be clearly distinguished from the concept of ‘open source sustainability’, which is, however, also of central importance within this study:

**Open Sustainability** refers to the use of open technical and cultural approaches towards sustainable outcomes. The field examines how open culture, technology and methods can contribute to environmental, social and economic sustainability. It is concerned with what and how openness as a philosophy is instrumental to sustainability through the acceleration of transparent and collaborative innovation. Within this study, this aspect will be dealt with in detail, with a particular focus on environmental sustainability in open source software.

Previous publications dealing with the concept of open sustainability focus primarily on [open innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation) in a corporate environment<sup><a href="https://lutpub.lut.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/158649/ukko_et_al_sustainable_development_final_draft.pdf">1</a></sup>. The role of science and free communities is not considered here, although especially in the open source sector these groups account for the majority of developments. Our study shows that the application of openness is not only crucial for sustainable innovation. It also creates transparency and trust in decision-making for sustainable development.

**Open Source Sustainability** refers to the ability of an open source project and its community to sustain themselves over a long period of time and to adapt the project to new circumstances and technologies. A strong community and governance structure is central to delivering bug fixes and new features.

Open source sustainability is widely known and analysed in detail within numerous books and publications<sup><a href="https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public">2</a></sup>. A whole [ecosystem has emerged](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand#a-handy-guide-to-financial-support-for-open-source) with the objective to commercialise the support, risk analysis and funding of open source software. Within the Linux Foundation, a new community emerged to determine the health state of an open source project: Community Health Analytics Open Source Software ([CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/)). Another strong community that has formed in this space is [Sustain](https://sustainoss.org/). This work is important, as large, well-known projects typically receive more donations than small ones. However, small modular projects can be critical to the global digital infrastructure. Even though large companies use these projects, donations are small compared to the development resources that are required.<sup><a href="https://staltz.com/software-below-the-poverty-line.html">4</a></sup>
