# Terminology

When it comes to complex (socio-technical-ecological) systems, many different perspectives can be taken depending on the context. This study examines the relationship between three intersecting dimensions – open source culture, technology, and environmental sustainability – from the perspective of ‘open sustainability’. This term must be clearly distinguished from other similar concepts relevant to this study.

\- Dimensions of open sustainability.

**Sustainability** is a concept that is concerned with meeting the needs of the present without compromising the resources of future generations. Sustainable systems are those that meet the current needs of many individuals involved in producing, deciding, and using a commons without compromising the ability of future generations also to meet their needs”. In this sense, sustainability is achieved “as long as the average rate of withdrawal does not exceed the average rate of replenishment".<sup><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6284197">1</a></sup>

**Open sustainability** is a method of using open cultural and technical approaches towards sustainable outcomes. The concept refers to the adoption of open source culture, technology and methods as a means of contributing to all three dimensions of sustainability – ecological, economic and social. It is concerned with how openness as a philosophy is instrumental to sustainability through the acceleration of transparent and collaborative innovation. Within this study, this concept is dealt with in detail, with a particular focus on environmental sustainability.

Previous definitions of open sustainability are broadly focused on [open innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation) within the context of sustainable development, often purely from an internal corporate perspective.<sup><a href="https://lutpub.lut.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/158649/ukko_et_al_sustainable_development_final_draft.pdf">2</a></sup> We consider open source as an essential component of transparent and collaborative innovation, therefore, provide a more narrow definition that explicitly embodies open source culture and methods, without restricting its application to any one actor. [Open source appropriate technology (OSAT)](https://www.appropedia.org/Open_Source_Appropriate_Technology), coined by the [Open Design movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-design_movement), is another related term. Appropriate technology – considered to be largely sustainable, small and appropriate – is within the scope of open sustainability. However, open sustainability is not prescriptive concerning the design specifications or implementation details of technologies. Instead, it defines methods and guiding principles from which similar technological attributes can emerge.

**Digital sustainability** is another related term, defined as the "process of applying social, economic, and environmental stewardship principles to digital products, services, and data delivered via the internet".<sup><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/6/3530">3</a></sup> It is often included within digital transformation strategies. While digital sustainability is an aspect of open sustainability, open sustainability is predicated on openness and makes this explicit. Furthermore, digital sustainability is constrained to digital products, whereas open sustainability is not. <!-- This should not be confused with "sustainable digitalisation" (also known as **sustainable digital transformation**), which is concerned with sustaining digital sovereignty in the long term. -->

**Sustainable technology** is a broad term most commonly used to refer to clean energy sources and systems that minimise environmental impact. For example, so-called "green software", which is concerned with lowering the energy consumption and carbon intensity of cloud computing, would be considered a sustainable technology. Whereas an energy-intensive climate model may not be sustainable in its operation, it can provide critical insight that informs sustainable decision-making with vast implications.

**Open source sustainability** refers to the ability of an open source project and its community to sustain themselves over a long period of time and to adapt the project to new circumstances and technologies. A strong community and governance structure is central to delivering bug fixes and new features.

Open source sustainability is widely known and analysed in detail within numerous books and publications.<sup><a href="https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public">4</a></sup> A whole [ecosystem has emerged](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand#a-handy-guide-to-financial-support-for-open-source) with the objective to commercialise the support, risk analysis and funding of open source software. Within the Linux Foundation, a new community emerged to determine the health state of an open source project: Community Health Analytics Open Source Software ([CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/)). Another strong community that has formed in this space is [Sustain](https://sustainoss.org/). This work is important, as large, well-known projects typically receive more donations than small ones. However, small modular projects can be critical to the global digital infrastructure. Even though large companies use these projects, donations are small compared to the development resources that are required.<sup><a href="https://staltz.com/software-below-the-poverty-line.html">5</a></sup>
