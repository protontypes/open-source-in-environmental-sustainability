# Collaboration

- **Connecting projects to local use cases.** Cities and towns can play a central role in applying various environmental datasets and models as they translate findings into action on the ground. However, they often lack the skills and knowledge to use OSS. Therefore, OSS project developers must integrate such OSS products into more usable interfaces. At the same time, the integration of datasets from different sites can contribute significantly to the generalisation of models and tools. Data Science working directly at city governments can also contribute significantly to bridging the gaps between urban application and research. Both sides can benefit considerably from partnerships by providing researchers with local data from multiple sites, while cities can support their application and integration.

- **Further strengthening the interconnectivity of communities**. A flourishing ecosystem of knowledge sharing and exchange between communities needs a platform where projects, ideas and news can be distributed. Before Open Sustain Tech was established, many organisations, users and developers could not get an overview of the active projects within and across topics in OSS for sustainability. Making OSS communities robust and better connected can alleviate the increased contributor risk and provide opportunities for teams to form and contribute more equitably. This helps consolidate and further develop shared values, visions, mindsets and ideas related to Open Sustainable Principles.

- **Train maintainers to preserve open-source projects for the long run.** Maintainers must be trained in both software development as well as community and project management. Many lead developers are experts in their fields but don't know how to build and maintain a community around their projects, while marketing and other entrepreneurial activities are overlooked. It is also frequently assumed that a high-quality project will quickly find its users and contributors, which is often not the case in practice. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of training materials and opportunities tailored to the unique characteristics of OSS projects. Open-source business models based on potentially irregular donations are not viable for many large projects, and a more consistent income stream is required. Despite the increased adoption of new business models, documented approaches and training opportunities are still lacking.
