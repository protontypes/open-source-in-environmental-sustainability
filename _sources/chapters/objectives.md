## Objectives 

OSS is a public good, but no one is responsible for stewarding and funding it. OSS providers frequently lack a business model, resulting in a systemic lack of investment in digital infrastructure when societies' reliance on it is growing. While there is a general trend toward more widespread use and adoption of open-source technology projects, there is no systematic assessment of which projects can be considered critical digital infrastructure or where significant funding and resourcing gaps exist in OSS for environmental sustainability.

For the past two years, Open Sustainable Technology has mapped the OSS ecosystem in sustainability and climate technology. An OSS ecosystem is defined as a collection of related software projects that co-evolve in the same environment. **This study examines the health and state of this emerging ecosystem and evaluates the impact of open-source culture on environmental sustainability**. **A central objective is to create strategies and visions to accelerate the use of open-source technologies in all sustainable technologies**. Based on this study, we also attempt to consolidate existing heterogeneous open source projects that can be combined into a common operating system for environmental intelligence.
