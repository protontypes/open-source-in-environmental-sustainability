# Objectives

OSS is a public good, yet no one is responsible for stewarding and funding it. While OSS providers contribute immense value to society and the economy, the ecosystem's contributions are largely underappreciated, resulting in a systemic lack of investment, and ultimately limiting many projects' long-term sustainability and its potential impact. While there is a general trend toward more widespread use and adoption of open source projects in sustainability, there is no systematic assessment of which projects can be considered critical digital infrastructure or where significant funding and resourcing gaps exist. 

For the past two years, Open Sustainable Technology has mapped the OSS ecosystem in sustainability and climate technology. An OSS ecosystem is defined as a collection of related software projects that co-evolve within the same environment. This study examines the health and state of this emerging ecosystem and evaluates the impact of open source culture on environmental sustainability. **The central objective is to create a vision and develop strategies to accelerate the use of open source in sustainable technologies**. To achieve this, the following objectives are pursued:
* Provide evidence about dynamics and the relationships between software projects, products, communities, and organisations in the open source ecosystem for environmental sustainability.
* Give developers, users, communities and contributors an overview on risk and potential of existing projects and thus help which projects need support or can be used as dependencies for new projects.
* Identification of untapped potential and recommendations based on analysis to support existing projects financially or through other resources.
* Identify the potential of existing developments for an environmental intelligence operating system across disciplines
