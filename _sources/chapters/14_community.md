# Community

Establishing communities of developers and users brings open source projects closer to long-term viability. Developers and project leaders should be deliberate about attracting the type of community that is best suited to support the OSS project. To understand how organisations and people contribute to the community, we're focusing on two community types:

- **The community of contributors**. Software developers, architects, and designers who write code, update documentation and contribute in a multitude of ways.
- **The community of users**. End users who find value in the OSS product, provide feedback and expert knowledge and can act as project evangelists.

The analysis of the communities is divided into different chapters:
