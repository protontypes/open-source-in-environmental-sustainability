    "**Building a strong community of developers and users is the key factor in bringing open source projects closer to long-term sustainability.** Depending on the size of a project, it is necessary to integrate enough new active developers into the organisation. To do this, the project must create both a culture and the technical means to participate in the community. This makes it possible for newcomers to advance from the first small contributions to main developers or maintainers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open source projects have different contributor types who undertake a variety of activities ranging from code development, community management, and event planning, to documentation and marketing. Analysing how many people are developing a project, and who the contributors are, is crucial to understanding organisational and personal engagement with open source projects. The broader OSS-for-sustainability ecosystem can share and learn best practices from some of the projects with the most contributors. For the purposes of the analysis, a person was considered a contributor if he or she made at least one commit to the Git repository. \n"
