# Funding Models

There is a broad range of funding models behind the actors in this sector. Academic and research funding, as well as private sector investment and government grants, have all benefited these projects. Because the structure and ecosystem behind each project differ, each project ecosystem has different funding models. 

**Only 3.8% of the projects studied officially offer GitHub users the option to donate.** This is particularly difficult to explain due to the high proportion of purely community-based projects. One reason could be the low usage and popularity in general, which leads to developers not even expecting to receive donations.

**Public sector funding from research councils, the EU, academic labs and national labs play a transformative role in sustaining OSS projects in sustainability.** Universities are not only knowledge providers but can also bring stability, independence and access to developer resources via their [Research Software Engineering](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Software_Engineering) teams. 

**However, there are very few dedicated funds for OSS development and maintenance in sustainability.** Large academic projects prioritise academic research and dedicate tiny amounts of funding to open source software development. Where there are funds, such as UKRI's Infrastructure Fund in the UK, or Horizon Europe, they primarily aim to support new feature development (and frequently not at the scale that supports significant strategic software developments). There is no dedicated fund or consideration around maintenance; Developers and Research software engineers, in academic labs are trying to squeeze in person months in multiple concurrent projects and make that open infrastructure re-usable across many projects. Features are used across many different projects, so you can't say exactly how much maintenance or user support costs there are.

This challenge is also reflected in OSS projects developed by think tanks, whereby funding for a new project is relatively easy to obtain while virtually impossible for maintaining the software and data infrastructure. It's really hard to get a proposal, a grant proposal that says we're going to make it continue to be what it is. One of the few good examples here is the [Shuttleworth Foundation](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/).

**Projects with a bigger user base (e.g.** [**openFAST**](https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast)**) have a mix of investments, grants and a small income from the industry.** However, these projects are more likely to get stuck in technical debt, making maintenance and future development even more expensive. These more mature projects should be better funded by industry. If projects want to maintain the work for the longer term, someone other than the lab would have to establish a business structure and legal entity to be able to take donations. This is currently not feasible in government-funded labs, research councils, and academic labs. 

**Collaborations between industry and academia present new challenges and opportunities.** The developers we spoke with were familiar with hybrid business models like Open Core, where the core code base is open source. Here, functions that are needed within larger companies are offered under a proprietary licence. At the same time, maintainers want to support open source without it being at the cost of the community; They are mindful that their users might get upset if they feel that open source work is being used for profit by companies.

**Industry-consulting models have mixed success so far.** In some circumstances (like green IT/data centre operations), open sourcing the code was a hard requirement from the developer and reactions from industrial partners have been positive. In other instances, companies wanted to keep the project work modelled after their systems (like batteries) closed source for two years as they were worried that their competitors would use them for free. However, it is both logistically challenging to have a closed source component of an open source package and slow progress towards sustainable development.

**Finally, it is critical to demonstrate and quantify the impact of OSS sustainability projects in the industry.** Government departments fund academic labs that in turn collaborate with industry partners to develop new features. In addition, research funders and government agencies, such as the US Department of Energy, are interested in encouraging innovation in specific strategic sectors, such as renewable energy. When academic projects can demonstrate to public funders the value of open source work outside academia and show a return on investment, it becomes easier for those projects to raise funds.
