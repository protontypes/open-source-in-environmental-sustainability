    "**The use of various licences reveals potential intellectual property issues related to the use of software packages as well as the general openness of the projects.** Licences ensure that communities behind many of today's most innovative technologies can protect their creations in whatever way they see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Permissive licences like BSD, Apache and MIT are the most popular within the field of sustainability. The MIT licence was the top choice, used in ~26% of the projects.** MIT is a short and simple permissive licence. Permissive licences are easier to use in commercial products, and unlike the copyleft licence, they do not enforce the release of all code under a similar licence associated with the open source project. Permissive licences like MIT create many opportunities for the reuse and commercialisation of OSS projects within proprietary software. On the other hand, projects under this licence may be jeopardised by the use of proprietary products; Companies are not forced to release bug fixes or enhancements, so improvements can not be contributed back into the open source project. In some cases, this can lead to developers losing motivation to contribute over time, as it becomes evident that the capacity for the broader development effort diminishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The second most used licence was a Custom licence with 24%.** All projects that could not be mapped to standard open source licences are considered custom licences. Licences with modifications from the original open source licences also fall under this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPL 3.0 is the third most popular licence used by 17.3% of all projects.** Permissions under this strong copyleft licence require licensing the entire source code of the licenced works and modifications. GPL was created to protect software from becoming proprietary or private. Copyright and licence notices must be preserved, and contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. Copyleft licences are more prevalent in business models that rely on direct monetisation of the core project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the different categories, however, no small preference for one or the other licence can be identified. Compared with ecosystem-wide insights published by Mend, the distribution of licences differs in multiple ways. Instead of Apache, the GPL 3.0 is the most commonly used licence after MIT."
