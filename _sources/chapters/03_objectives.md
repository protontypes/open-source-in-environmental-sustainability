# Objectives

OSS is a public good, yet no one is responsible for stewarding and funding it. While OSS providers contribute immense value to society and the economy, the ecosystem's contributions are largely underappreciated, resulting in a systemic lack of investment, and ultimately limiting many projects' long-term sustainability and potential impact. While there is a general trend toward more widespread use and adoption of open source projects in sustainability, there is no systematic assessment of which projects can be considered critical digital infrastructure or where significant funding and resourcing gaps exist.

For the past two years, Open Sustainable Technology has mapped the OSS ecosystem in sustainability and climate technology. An OSS ecosystem is defined as a collection of related software projects that co-evolve within the same environment. This study examines the health and state of this emerging ecosystem and evaluates the impact of open source culture on environmental sustainability. A central objective is to create strategies and visions to accelerate the use of open source technologies in all sustainable technologies. Based on this study, we also attempt to consolidate existing heterogeneous open source projects that can be combined into a common operating system for environmental intelligence.
